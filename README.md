FOR_Loops_Forever Workshop
==========================

WORKSHOP on FOR loops, their history, their structure and their possibilities for creating graphic form.


Workshop was given 8 novemember 2014 at Paris College of Art, Paris. Original title , "Dessines moi des boucles FOR ever". The aim of the workshop was to present a little of the history behind one of the most important programming structures and introduce its workings. I chose to concentrate on one particular application of FOR loops from a graphic design perspective. Put plainly, we worked on how repetition can be used to design visual patterns. 

All sketches we coded in Processing and are the examples used to introduce key concepts for the participants to learn and develop their own ideas. Further information can be read at the following website :
